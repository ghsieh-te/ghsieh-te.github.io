          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p><!--summary desc-->
            As an animal lover, I’m constantly flooded by posts across social media on my handheld devices about pets from local shelters and rescues needing fosters or forever homes. It is only appropriate that people can browse databases for adoptable pets and apply to adopt on our handheld devices with the same ease. PawPrints gives organizations of all sizes an equal playing ground to reach potential adopters through the convenience of their handheld devices.

          <h1>The Problem</h1>
          <p><!--problem desc-->
            Every day there are dogs and cats sitting in shelters and foster homes waiting for someone to come by and give them a permanent place to call home and a family to love for the rest of the life. Standing beside these animals through this struggle are countless volunteers and organizations hoping to connect these animals to their humans, but the visibility of these organizations and the animals they are helping are not all equal. Browsing through individual sites can also get tedious, potential adopters lack a centralized place to store and organize information about the pets and their applications. PawPrints is here to bring animals and their future families one step closer by giving all the animals a fair chance at being seen regardless of the size of their organization and streamlining the adoption process with the click of a button.

            Each animal deserves a chance to shine in the spotlight regardless of the organization that is providing them temporary shelter. PawPrints will be a database for large shelters and small organizations to let users see an all inclusive list of adoptable pets that are currently available. Each organization’s database will be managed by their individual staff so that they are able to add and remove pets from their list as their records change. While there are similar apps that currently exist, PawPrints has an additional feature where applications can be submitted and tracked from the app itself.

          <h1>Branding</h1>
          <p><!--branding desc-->
            Before I could start my mockups, I needed to established the visual aspects of the brand: Logo, font, and color story. I started a mind mapping exercise to gather ideas through word association before I began sketching out potential designs. The two words I chose to start with were “pet” and “family” and proceeded to write down all the words that popped up in my mind. <br><br>

            When I started sketching the logo, I wanted to make sure that my design wasn’t too rigid and had a little personality. I wanted to make it something people could easily recognize but also charming. Utilizing negative space is something that I always enjoyed as a designer and was apparent through many of my sketches, giving the viewer just enough information and letting their minds fill in the rest. I went through a few iterations before I settled on my final logo that I wanted to move forward with.<br><br>

            The color palette was the one component that had the most revisions throughout the design process. I knew I wanted to start with blue, the color of trust. Knowing that there will be a lot of photo elements throughout the application, I wanted to keep an analogous color scheme that wouldn’t take away from the photos. I chose to start with a royal blue that had the right amount of energy, and that was the only color that remained consistent through the rest of my prototypes and into the final color story. A lot of the changes came through my mockups and realizing that I didn’t need that many colors, I only had so many components on each page and I didn’t want to distract the user by using too many colors. Another deciding factor was accessibility and how colors might fail because they didn’t have enough contrast. I opted for more shades of grey instead of black because the text was feeling very harsh and added a light blue to play with for icons and text against the royal blue background when needed.<br><br>

            As for the Font, I originally chose to try using Montserrat and Raleway as my main fonts and stuck with it through all my mockups and even for my final prototype, but I decided in the end that while the change didn’t take away from the user experience, it did not add to it either and was not worth keeping.

            The biggest challenges and changes that occurred through the revisions of my mockups were related to duplication in navigation options. I had started with small icons in a footer navigation bar and a grabber for a menu in the top left header. The users that I tested this design with had used both functions, but through feedback and further thought, I realized I didn’t need to give them both options even if they were both intuitive. One piece of feedback that was mentioned was to keep in mind how the footer navigation interacts with a keyboard, which ultimately led to the decision on using a side menu. Another area that felt duplicative was my dashboard, which housed many of the same links that I included in my menu. The dashboard page didn’t have any specific information or action that couldn’t be added to the menu or other pages, so I decided to eliminate it and lead the user to the search filter once they log in.<br><br>

            Aside from the navigation, another area that went through multiple iterations was my text input fields. I had started my first mockup with boxes for each field and placeholder text rather than a title. Per some of the feedback I received that the layout looked dated, I went back to the iOS HIG and adopted a cleaner layout with only the anchor line to denote text fields. Another call out I received was that placeholder text makes a form less accessible because the labels will be replaced once text is entered. I went back and forth on this particular decision quite a few times. Because of the simplicity of the anchor line, it was hard to make the labels look like they weren’t floating, and all the the fields of information were pretty straight forward and should be recognizable even with the labels. Anything that has a picker will include the default placeholder text as the top option. The iOS HIG guide also stated to use placeholder text where applicable, and to only use labels if the placeholder text didn’t seem appropriate. I decided to revert back to using placeholder text in place of labels to clean up the layout.

            As I was working through the last little details from my prototype, I ran a few quick preference tests to get some feedback. I tested variations of three different areas in my app. The first was between a picker or list for any input field that has a drop down list to choose from. Of the participants 86% preferred a picker because they liked being able to see the page that they were selecting an option for. They also felt that the picker felt less stale and more intuitive, especially for those who were iOS users. The second design aspect of my preference test was a smaller detail, stylized text. This particular test result was the least polarized of the three, with 67% of the participants preferring distinguished text stylization for different categories of information. Those who preferred the option with only two text styles explained that they were minimalistic in nature and felt that less was better. The final preference test was on two different versions of my “Contact Us” form. The results showed that 83% of the users preferred having the text input area for the message to be defined. In their explanations for their decisions, some participants felt that both versions made sense, but the light grey background helped them eliminate the guesswork and felt more intuitive.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p><!--conclusion desc-->
            PawPrints can make a user’s search for their next adopted pet easier by being able to take their search with them wherever they are and utilize their downtime when they’re not at a computer. They will be able to organize the various components of their search, like sending and tracking applications for pets in one centralized app. There were a lot of components that I wanted to add when I first started creating a sitemap and plotting the user stories, but I had to take the time to think about what added to the user experience and what didn’t. I realized quickly that less is more when I am duplicating actions on the same screen. Where I initially thought I was helping the user by providing more navigation options to allow them to use the app how they prefer would actually take away from maximizing the space in the design and potentially confuse users.<br><br>

            My initial doubts were mostly while I was conducting competitor research. I kept asking myself how can I be better than what I already see and how would I convince new users that PawPrints is better. As I kept researching, I would constantly be keeping track of the pros and cons of each competitor along with what I felt was missing, and that was how I began to build out my blueprint for what PawPrints would be. The results to my initial survey was probably the most surprising to me, but also in a good way. It was great to see how people all took their individual approaches to search for their pets, and through some of the interviews, how prepared or unprepared they felt when they took their new friend home. The survey quickly outlined the key problems that I wanted to address: too many options with unexpected availability, many organizations that were unknown, and the lack of a centralized place to organize all the necessary information. As I tested wireframes and prototypes with different users, it was great to see how they could see PawPrints fitting into their lives and also making their search easier.<br><br>

            While I am satisfied with how the process in creating PawPrints took place and the result, I would have loved to build more visual components and icons to give the application a little more personality. I learned to rely more heavily on the HIG guidelines and to also assess what is necessary, what did I give the user that they didn’t know they needed, and what may seem like a good function but takes away from their experience by being a distraction. These are all important learnings that I will definitely continue to apply to every project that I work on to cross check myself and make sure I always deliver a product that has a clear vision and purpose for the user.
