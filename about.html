          <h1>Who am I?</h1>
          <p>Growing up, I was always known as the child who dived head first into every art and craft project with curiosity and passion. I found all the opportunities to fill the blank space in the margins of my homework with doodles and spent more time drawing a cover for my book report than writing the actual report. While my respect for the blank margins on my homework grew with the encouragement of my teachers after a few years in school, my curiosity and desire to create never vanished. That desire to design led me to complete a <strong>BFA in Fashion Design at Otis College of Art and Design</strong> years later and has shaped my career over time.<br/><br/>

          I worked for a few years in the fashion industry as an apparel designer for Abercrombie and Fitch and then for Tea Collection when I moved back to the <strong>SF Bay Area</strong>. While I love the skills I learned as an apparel designer, I learned I have a greater curiosity for function and the ever-changing world of digital design.  I decided to take the leap and pursue a career in UI/UX to learn, understand, and design in an industry that is filled with excitement and endless opportunities.
